This is the instrumentation code for Bochs. It's been tested with Bochs 2.6.2.

1. Copy mytool to bochs-code/instrument/mytool
2. Install xorg-dev library
3. ./configure --enable-instrumentation="instrument/stubs"  --prefix=/debug/bochs --enable-debugger

After you boot the OS:

bochs> instrument start ---> to start the log of memory access
bochs> instrument stop  ---> to stop the log of memory access

You can use either standard I/O or file to output the log. Please check instrument.cc to modify it.
